BakeR database documentation
================================================================================================

Contents which will be discussed in this section:
=================================================

	database.py			 Clusters all contents of the database in a Database object, contains methods to load and save them safely and contains methods for logging the progress of the robot.
	database_classes.py	 Contains definitions of the objects which are stored in the database
	database_handler.py	 Contains all methods for editing the database, in particular also for calculating things from the data the database provides


File information:
=================

	database.py
		WHAT IT DOES:
			- Contains all data of a database set on the disk such that the data can be accessed by Python scripts
			- Synchronizes the contents of a database instance with the files saved on a disk in a safe way, in order to avoid data loss
			- Creates and updates log files which document the progress of cleaning
		REQUIREMENTS FOR USAGE:
			- database file set on disk
		BASIC FUNCTION:
			- LOADING:
				When loading the contents from a database set on the disk, database tries to find an intact file set. This will be a temporal file set if there is a complete one.
				Having loaded the JSON files, dictionaries will be created based on the file stream.
				The contents of the dictionaries are then first converted into a suitable format (e.g. date string --> datetime.Datetime object) and then fed into instances of the classes of database_classes.py.
			- SAVING:
				Depending on whether it should be saved as temporal version or not, temporal files will be created or overwritten.
				From the attributes contained in database, dictionaries are created. Therefore, data types unsuitable for JSON are converted (e.g. datetime.Datetime object --> string).
				A string which is of JSON syntax will be created based on the dictionaries and saved into the designated files.
			- ADDING A LOG ENTRY
				database loads the correct log JSON file in a similar manner to the loading routine described above. If there is no such file, a new one will be created.
				database creates a backup file, which contains the same data as the loaded file.
				database adds the wanted log entry to the loaded log.
				database saves the updated log into the original file.
				database removes the backup file.
		USAGE:
			- If you want to have a loaded Database object
				1. Initialize database instance. State a file path, if it is not in the same directory as the location of database.py.
				2. Run def loadDatabase()
			- If you want to save a loaded Database object
			  Run def saveCompleteDatabase(). Depending on whether you want so save it temporarily or finally, state "temporal_file=<True/False>".
			- If you want to add a new log entry
			  Run def addLogEntry(log_element). log_element must be the logItem object you want to add. Better use def database_handler.DatabaseHandler.addLogEntry()
			- If you want to delete all temporal files in order to let the robot forget everything that just happened
			  Run discardTemporalDatabase()
		METHOD INFORMATION:
			- @staticmethod <XXX>: Converts between datatypes, such as string, datetime, point32, array.
			- def update<XXX>(self, dict): Reads the provided dict and adds the [converted] elements into the database_classes attributes of the database.
			- def get<XXX>dictFrom<XXX>(self): Returns a dict containing the [converted] attributes of the database_classes attributes of the database.
			- def readFiles(self, temporal): Internal method for loading the JSON files. Public shall call def loadDatabase().
			- def checkIntegrity(self, temporal): Internal method for checking whether a database set is damaged or not by trying to check certain database entries.
			- def save<RoomDatabase/GlobalApplicationData>(self, temporal=True): Method which saves the rooms list of the database / the global application data.
			- def updateRunCount(self, date): Updates the amount of application executions per day. Parameter date must be the wanted date as datetime.Datetime.
			- def getCurrentLogfileName(self): Returns the file name of the current log file.
			- def addLogEntry(self, log): Adds a log entry in the current log file. Parameter log must be the LogItem instance to be added.
			- def discardTemporalDatabase(self): Deletes all temporal files without saving their content. Also sets the application prograss variable to 4 (i.e. DISCARDED).
			- def loadDatabase(self): Method to real all database related files on the disk.
			- def saveCompleteDatabase(self, temporal_file=True): Method to save all entries of database in files on the disk. Parameter temporal_file indicates whether the original or temporal files are overwritten.
			- def getRoom(self, room_id): Method which returns a pointer to the RoomItem with room ID room_id.


	database_classes.py
		WHAT IT DOES:
			- Contains definitions for classes, which resemble the attributes of Database 
				- RobotProperties
				- GlobalSettings
				- GlobalMapData
				- GlobalApplicationData
				- LogItem
				- RoomIssue
				- RoomItem
		REQUIREMENTS FOR USAGE:
			- (None)
		USAGE:
			- (Internal only, none relevant for public)
		METHOD INFORMATION:
			- (Internal only, none relevant for public)



	database_handler.py
		WHAT IT DOES:
			- Reads a Database object and creates a list of due and overdue rooms
			- Writes timestamps in the database
			- Restores a cleaning progress after sudden stop of program
			- Converts contents of the database into a format suitable for the existing action servers
		REQUIREMENTS FOR USAGE:
			- Database instance
		USAGE:
			- If you want a list of all due rooms
			  Run def getAllDueRooms()
			- If you want a list of all overdue rooms
			  Run def getAllOverdueRooms()
			- If you want to declare a cleaning subtask to be finished
			  Run def checkoutCompletedRoom(room, assignment_type). See database_classes.py for definition of assignment_type.
		METHOD INFORMATION:
			- @staticmethod <XXX>: Returns information on the current day such as week type, week day, schedule index.
			- def getMapAndRoomInformationInPixel(self, rooms_array): Method which returns a map and RoomInformation instances (in Pixel) out of an array of RoomItem instances.
			- def getRoomInformationInMeter(self): Method which returns RoomInformation instances (in Meter) out of an array of RoomItem instances.
			- def getRoomMapping(self, rooms_list, room_sequence_result): Method which creates a mapping that maps the room sequence order to the RoomItem.room_id_.
			- def getAllDueRooms(self): Method which adds the due room cleaning tasks in the corresponding RoomItem instances of database. Affected RoomItem instances will be added in the due_rooms_ array of database_handler.
			- def restoreDueRooms(self): Method which looks for RoomItem instances of database which do have any open cleaning task and collects them in a list.
			- def getAllOverdueRooms(self): Method which adds the overdue room cleaning tasks in the corresponding RoomItem instances of database. Affected RoomItem instances will be added in the overdue_rooms_ array of database_handler.
			- def noPlanningHappenedToday(self): Method that returns a boolean value whether a planning process was performed today already.
			- def sortRoomsList(self, rooms_list): Method that creates two arrays out of rooms_list. The first array contains all the rooms which must be cleaned dry and the ons which only need empty trashcans. The second array contains all the rooms which need to be cleaned wet. In general, the two arrays are not disjunct.
			- def checkoutCompletedRoom(self, room, assignment_type): Method that updates the corresponding time stamp of a specified room and removes the specified assignment from its open cleaning tasks.
			- def addLogEntry(self, ...): Method that creates a new LogItem instance out of the provided parameters and saves it in the current log file.

The uppermost script, concerning the wet cleaning application, is application_wet_cleaning.py.
Any other script, concerning the wet cleaning application, will be called from there.

=======================================================

- Loads database
- Retrieves all due rooms and sorts them after cleaning method
- Performs dry cleaning process of due rooms
- Performs wet cleaning process of due rooms
- Retrieves all overdue rooms and sorts them after cleaning method
- Performs dry cleaning process of overdue rooms
- Performs wet cleaning process of overdue rooms
- Documents completion of cleaning
